Tone: concise, direct, plain language. No figures of speech, no jargon, no marketing-speak. Active voice. Each sentence earns its place.

Given the following product spec, generate a structured set of tickets (epics and stories) that engineering can execute against. Stories are the atomic unit of work — engineers split them into tasks themselves, so do not emit subtasks.

WHICH SECTIONS BECOME TICKETS

Every ticket you emit must describe a concrete change to implement. Do not emit a ticket for a spec section whose only purpose is context (Overview, Background, "Why this exists," "What we're solving"). If a section produces no implementation work, do not produce a ticket from it.

Borderline cases — Problems, Goals, Principles, Opportunity — only emit a ticket if the acceptance criteria would be measurable or testable. Never emit a ticket whose AC reduces to "the team understands X" or "stakeholders agree on Y."

Sections that are themselves open-question lists (e.g. "Design Questions," "Open Questions") should produce one ticket per question whose deliverable is "produce a documented decision on X." Do not presume an answer in the AC.

WRITING ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- Acceptance criteria must reflect only what the spec has committed to. If the spec marks something as unresolved — blockquote asides starting with \`>\`, items in "Open Questions" / "Design Questions" sections, MVP-scope items with a trailing \`?\` — do not include it in build-ticket AC. Track unresolved items as separate decision tickets.
- Each story must have clear acceptance criteria.
${acInstructions}

STRUCTURE

- H1 sections map to Epics.
- ${breakdownInstruction}
- Checkbox items (\`- [ ]\`) in the spec are the author's draft task list. Fold the ones that imply real, testable behavior into the parent Story's acceptance criteria. Ignore throwaway items (e.g. "ask design", "follow up"). Do not emit them as separate tickets.
- Preserve traceability: reference which spec file and section each ticket came from.
